Observing Social Distancing Using YOLO V3


To practice social or physical distancing, stay at least 6 feet (about 2 arms’ length) 
from other people who are not from your household in both indoor and outdoor spaces.
Social distancing should be practiced in combination with other everyday preventive 
actions to reduce the spread of COVID-19, including wearing masks etc. Since people 
can spread the virus before they know they are sick, it is important to stay at least 6 feet 
away from others when possible, even if you or they do not have any symptoms. Social 
distancing is especially important for people who are at higher risk for severe illness 
from COVID-19.

 When going out in public, it is important to stay at least 6 feet away from other people 
and wear a mask to slow the spread of COVID-19.

Keeping a set physical distance from each other and avoiding hugs and gestures that 
involve direct physical contact, reduce the risk of becoming infected during outbreaks 
of infectious respiratory diseases (for example, flu pandemics and the COVID-19 
pandemic of 2020.)These distances of separation, in addition to personal hygiene 
measures, wearing mask, sanitize are also recommended at places of work.
To minimize the likelihood of coming in contact with these droplets, it is recommended 
that any two persons should maintain a physical distance of 1.8 meters apart 
(approximately 6 feet). Different governing bodies have different rules for safe social 
distancing and different penalties for breaking them.
